I am a fourth-year PhD student at ALGO Lab, School of Computing and Data Science, the University of Hong Kong. I am honored to be advised by Prof. Zhiyi Huang. I obtained my BSc in Mathematics also from the University of Hong Kong, where I was honored to be supervised by Professor Wong, Tak Kwong for my final year project in optimal control theory.

My current research interest lies in online algorithms and approximation algorithms. Specifically, I am interested in classic stopping time problems including Matroid Secretary, Pandora's Box Problem and Prophet Inequality, focusing on the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, and the adaptivity gap in online decision making.
