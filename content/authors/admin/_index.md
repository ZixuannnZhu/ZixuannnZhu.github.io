I am a fourth-year PhD student at ALGO Lab, School of Computing and Data Science, the University of Hong Kong. I am honored to be advised by Prof. Zhiyi Huang. I obtained my BSc in Mathematics also from the University of Hong Kong, where I was honored to be supervised by Professor Wong, Tak Kwong for my final year project in optimal control theory.

My current research interest lies in online algorithms and approximation algorithms. Specifically, I am interested in classic stopping time problems like Matroid Secretary, Pandora's Box and Prophet Inequality, investigating the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. I am also interested in the adaptivity gap in online decision making.
